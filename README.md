# My Nature Outing Tool

Nature studies offer Finnish students time to engage with nature and to learn about their own environmental impact. Finnish schools adopt a transdisciplinary approach to understanding environmental education, which contrasts with the U.S. approaches, where environmental education is almost solely taught during science courses and touched on only briefly through earth science standards. By un-disciplining environmental education, Finnish citizens have some of the most advanced content knowledge as it relates to climate change, and their policies, cultural practices, and aesthetics reflect that knowledge.

We've adapted the holistic, nature-centered methods we witnessed in the field to create My Nature Study and My Nature Outing, coding templates offering students an opportunity to work with tools to construct meaning in their world. Through this project of languaging and communicating their relationship with the natural environment, students will learn essential computer science concepts and learn to read/edit .html and .css documents.
 
### This template includes responsive design and cool tools like modal views. 

**-Commune with Nature**

**-Use Tools to construct meaning**

**-Scaffold Multimodal Learning**

**-Inform Environmental Policy**

## Get started!

1. Go to repository My Nature Outing repository: [Here](https://github.com/Open-Fuego/my-nature-outing)

2. Click "Code" then "Download ZIP" to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Move this folder to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and/or open a text editor like [brackets.io](https://brackets.io), [atom.io](https://atom.io), or [notepad-plus-plus.org](notepad-plus-plus.org). 

5. Use the text editor to open the style.css and index.html documents from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text! 

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes." 

8. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

9. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

10. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.

## Working with a Chromebook?

1.	Open your Chromebook and Sign into your Gmail Account.

2.	Go to GitHub.com, then search for/open My Nature Outing 
3.	Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP."
 
4.	Find and open the “my-nature-outing-main-zip” file in “Files/Downloads.”Then drag this folder into “MyFiles”  

5.	You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera.

6.	Next in your browser, search for “Code Pad Code Editor” for Chromebook. There are other choices, but I find this the easiest to use. 

7.	Use the Code Pad Text Editor to open the style.css and index.html documents from your project folder.

8.	Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text!

9.	Once you have modified content and transferred your assets to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes."

10.	Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

11.	This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

12.	Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.


## IPAD to Chromebook Help?

1.	Select your best photos. Rename photos using CamelCase.  SimpleName.jpg

2.	Connect Ipad to Chromebook.

3.	In your Chromebook “Files,” find your Ipad device, locate image assets and copy them into your project file. 

4.	For best quality, use a .wav audio recorder like Handy Recorder. Transfer your raw .wav audio files by emailing them to your gmail account then copying files into your project folder. Again, use CamelCase SimpleName.wav. Raw files may slow loading. In this case you might choose to convert your files to a lossy format such as mp3.
